# DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop

Welcome to your DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

### Overall Estimated timing: 150 minutes

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience working with Microsoft Fabric to analyze, process, and visualize data across various services. You will learn how to create a Fabric workspace, ingest and transform data using pipelines and Dataflows Gen2, and analyze it with Apache Spark. You'll also explore real-time data processing by creating Eventstreams and interacting with eventhouse for real-time insights. By the end of this lab, you'll be equipped with the skills to build end-to-end data workflows and real-time analytics solutions in Microsoft Fabric.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a Microsoft Fabric workspace, ingest and transform data using pipelines and Dataflows Gen2, analyze data with Apache Spark, and implement real-time analytics using Eventstreams and eventhouse.

1. **Analyze data with Apache Spark in Fabric**: You will learn how to use Apache Spark within Microsoft Fabric to explore and analyze large datasets. This task will guide you through creating Spark notebooks, running distributed data processing tasks, and performing data transformations to gain meaningful insights.

1. **Ingest data with a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to build data pipelines to ingest data from external sources into a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric. This includes using Apache Spark to apply custom transformations before loading the data for analysis.

1. **Create and use Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to create and configure Dataflows (Gen2) to connect to data sources and perform transformations using Power Query Online. This task introduces the core features of Dataflows and demonstrates how they can be used in pipelines or Power BI datasets.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic familiarity with Apache Spark and notebooks (e.g., using PySpark)
- Understanding of ETL/ELT processes and data transformation concepts
- Familiarity with real-time data concepts and streaming sources
- Basic knowledge of configuring Eventstreams with inputs, transformations, and outputs
- Understanding of Kusto Query Language (KQL) and basic SQL for querying event data

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Analyze data with Apache Spark in Fabric**: Learning how to use Apache Spark within Microsoft Fabric to explore and analyze large-scale datasets. This includes creating notebooks, executing distributed data operations, and performing transformations to uncover insights.

1. **Ingest data with a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric**: Building and configuring data pipelines to ingest data from external sources into a Fabric lakehouse. This process includes applying transformations using Apache Spark and automating data loading for analysis.

1. **Create and use Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric**: Understanding how to use Power Query Online to build Dataflows (Gen2), which connect to data sources, perform transformations, and feed downstream components like pipelines or Power BI reports.pipelines or Power BI datasets.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Apache Spark:** Apache Spark is the core, open-source, distributed computing engine powering data engineering and data science workloads, enabling users to analyze and process data at scale within a Lakehouse environment. 

1. **Pipeline:** A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that orchestrate data ingestion and transformation tasks, allowing users to create and manage complex data workflows through a graphical user interface.

1. **Dataflows (Gen2)**: Its a new generation of dataflows that allow you to connect to various data sources, perform transformations using Power Query Online, and then load the transformed data into various destinations like Lakehouses, Warehouses, or Azure SQL Databases, offering a low-code, cloud-based data preparation experience.
