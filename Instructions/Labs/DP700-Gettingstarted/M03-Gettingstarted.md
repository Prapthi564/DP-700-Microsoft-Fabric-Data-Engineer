# DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop

Welcome to your DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

### Overall Estimated timing: 210 minutes

In this hands-on lab, you will build an end-to-end real-time data streaming solution. You will start by creating an eventhouse and an eventstream to manage and process incoming data. You will then add a data source and configure a destination to route the processed data appropriately. After setting up the streaming infrastructure, you will create a real-time dashboard to visualize the data, including building a base query, adding parameters for dynamic insights, and customizing the dashboard with additional pages. Finally, you will configure auto-refresh settings to keep the data current and learn how to save and share the dashboard for collaboration.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab series, you will be able to create and manage a Microsoft Fabric eventhouse, configure eventstreams with real-time data sources and destinations, and build interactive real-time dashboards using base queries, parameters, and auto-refresh features to visualize and share live data insights effectively.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Get started with Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to use Real-Time Intelligence features in Microsoft Fabric to ingest, analyze, and visualize streaming data. This task focuses on building a real-time analytics solution using a live stream of stock market data.

1. **Ingest real-time data with Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to use Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric to capture, transform, and route real-time event data. This task involves ingesting live data from a bike-share system and configuring the stream to send processed events to various destinations.

1. **Work with data in a Microsoft Fabric eventhouse**: You will learn how to create and use an eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric to store and query real-time event data. This task involves populating the eventhouse with sample taxi ride data and using KQL and SQL to analyze the information.

1. **Create an Eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric**: Learning how to create an eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric to establish a centralized and scalable foundation for capturing and storing streaming data. This involves setting up a workspace, creating the eventhouse, and understanding how real-time events are persisted and organized for downstream analytics.

1. **Create an Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric**: Setting up an eventstream in Microsoft Fabric to enable real-time data ingestion from external systems. This includes connecting sources such as Azure Event Hub, IoT Hub, or other streaming services to start capturing and processing live event data.

1. **Add a Source to an Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric**: Learning how to integrate a streaming data source with your eventstream to begin ingesting real-time data from services like Event Hub or IoT Hub. This enables your eventstream to continuously capture event data for processing and analysis.

1. **Add a Destination to an Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric**: Understanding how to configure a destination for your eventstream to route processed streaming data to storage or analytics tools such as a lakehouse or KQL database, enabling real-time insights and integration with downstream systems.

1. **Create a Real-Time Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric**: Developing a real-time dashboard to visualize and monitor live data from an eventstream. This task helps in creating responsive dashboards for instant insights and better decision-making based on streaming data.

1. **Create a Base Query in Microsoft Fabric**: Learning how to design a base query for your dashboard to centralize common logic and streamline visualizations. This approach enhances efficiency, consistency, and maintainability of your data-driven reports.

1. **Add a Parameter to a Microsoft Fabric Dashboard**: Adding interactive parameters to your dashboard to allow filtering and customizing the displayed data. This enables users to explore specific segments, such as filtering by region or time range, for more focused insights.

1. **Add a Page to a Microsoft Fabric Dashboard**: Expanding your dashboard by adding multiple pages to organize and present different data views. This allows for better structure and improved navigation across diverse insights within a single dashboard experience.
